# PKGBUILDs for the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org)

Packages that I either maintain in the AUR, or have customized, managed as git subtrees so that I can easily host them on GitHub.

This is accomplished using Eli Schwartz's [aurpublish](https://github.com/eli-schwartz/aurpublish) utility.
